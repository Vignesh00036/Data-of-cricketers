## ETL Journey/Workflow:
<p>Data Scraping Process</p>
<p>We utilized the website <strong>www.sadian.com</strong> as our data source for scraping player information. The process involves the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<u><b>1. Website Access:</b></u>
<p>Our program leverages <strong>Selenium</strong> to open and interact with the <strong>www.sadian.com</strong> website programmatically.</p>

<b><u>2. Data Extraction:</u></b>
<p>Using <strong>Beautiful Soup</strong>, a powerful Python library, we efficiently scrape the list of players from the website, enabling us to collect the necessary data for analysis.</p>
</ul>
